# mad-location-manager 
This is a library for GPS and Accelerometer data "fusion" with Kalman filter. 
Project consists of 2 parts: gpsacckalmanfusion (AAR module) and 2 helper applications. Main thing here is gpsacckalmanfusion module.

## How can mad-location-manager help you to get location more accurately?

This module helps to increase GPS coordinate accuracy and smooth "jumps" from track. Also it helps to calculate the total distance of route. 

## The roadmap
### Visualizer 

- [x] Implement some route visualizer for desktop application
- [x] Implement Kalman filter and test all settings
- [x] Implement noise generator for logged data

### Filter 

- [x] Implement GeoHash function
- [x] Get device orientation
	- [x] Get device orientation using magnetometer and accelerometer + android sensor manager
	- [x] Get device orientation using magnetometer, accelerometer and gyroscope + Madgwick AHRS
	- [x] Get device orientation using rotation vector virtual sensor
- [x] Compare result device orientation and choose most stable one
- [x] Get linear acceleration of device (acceleration without gravity force)
- [x] Convert relative linear acceleration axis to absolute coordinate system (east/north/up)
- [x] Implement Kalman filter core
- [x] Implement Kalman filter for accelerometer and gps data "fusion"
- [x] Logger for pure GPS data, acceleration data and filtered GPS data.
- [ ] Restore route if gps connection is lost

### Library

- [x] Separate test android application and library
- [ ] Add library to maven repository
